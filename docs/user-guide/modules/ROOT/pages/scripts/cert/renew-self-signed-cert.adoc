{script_url}[This script^] will renew the private key `key.pem` and the self-signed certificate `cert.pem` in the given directory (`$PWD` if not given).

The optional second positive integer parameter (range: [1, 24855]) specifies the number of days the certificate is valid for; the default is 30 days.

The optional third parameter is the common name (`localhost` if not given) of the certificate to be renewed.

On macOS, the certificate will be renewed in the "login" keychain also.

[NOTE]
====
Chrome and Safari need no further configuration.

For Firefox the old certificate has to be xref:scripts/cert/delete-self-signed-cert.adoc#delete-self-signed-cert-firefox[deleted manually], and the renewed one has to be xref:scripts/cert/create-self-signed-cert.adoc#create-self-signed-cert-firefox[added manually].

Docker needs to be restarted.

[WARNING]
====
Certificates with more than 180 days validity will https://support.apple.com/en-us/103214[not be accepted by the Apple platform] or Safari.
