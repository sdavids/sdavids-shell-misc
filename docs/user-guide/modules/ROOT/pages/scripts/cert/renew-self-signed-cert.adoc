{script_url}[This script^] will renew a private key `key.pem` and a self-signed certificate `cert.pem`.

The following parameters are optional:

`c` :: the common name (`localhost` if not given) of the certificate
`d` :: the directory (`$PWD` if not given) containing the key and certificate
`v` :: the lifetime of the certificate in days (range: [1, 24855]; `30` if not given)
+
[WARNING]
====
Certificates with a lifetime exceeding 180 days will https://support.apple.com/en-us/103214[not be accepted by the Apple platform] or Safari.

As of March 15, 2029, the maximum lifetime for a certificate will be https://www.digicert.com/blog/tls-certificate-lifetimes-will-officially-reduce-to-47-days[47 days].
====

On macOS, the certificate will be renewed in the "login" keychain also.

[NOTE]
====
Chrome and Safari need no further configuration.

For Firefox the old certificate has to be xref:scripts/cert/delete-self-signed-cert.adoc#delete-self-signed-cert-firefox[deleted manually], and the renewed one has to be xref:scripts/cert/create-self-signed-cert.adoc#create-self-signed-cert-firefox[added manually].

Docker needs to be restarted.
