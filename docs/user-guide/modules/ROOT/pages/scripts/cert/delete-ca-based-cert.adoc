{script_url}[This script^] will remove the private key and the certificate from the certificate authority; and delete the key `key.pem` and the certificate `cert.pem` from the given directory (`$PWD` if not given).

If the given directory is not `$PWD` and is empty after the deletion it will be deleted as well.

The optional second parameter is the common name (`localhost` if not given) of the certificate to be removed.

[NOTE]
====
Chrome, Docker, Firefox, and Safari need no further configuration.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the xref:scripts/cert/create-ca.adoc[certificate authority has been created] and a xref:scripts/cert/create-ca-based-cert.adoc[private key and certificate have been created] before executing this script.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Additional xref:scripts/cert/copy-ca-based-cert.adoc[copies] will not be deleted by this script, i.e. only the private key and certificate in the given directory and the CA will be removed.
