:script_url: https://github.com/sdavids/sdavids-shell-misc/blob/main/scripts/cert/create_ca.sh

{script_url}[This script^] will create a certificate authority and its root certificate `ca.crt`.

The certificate authority will be created in the following location:

Linux::
+
. `$EASYRSA_PKI` (if set)
. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/easyrsa/pki` (if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set)
. `$HOME/.easyrsa/pki`

macOS::
+
. `$EASYRSA_PKI` (if set)
. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/easyrsa/pki` (if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set)
. `$HOME/Library/Application Support/easyrsa/pki`

The directory will be created if it does not exit yet.

The `ca.crt` root certificate will be created in the directory above.

On CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Mint, Red Hat, and Ubuntu the CA root certificate will be added to the trust store and made available to Linux command-line tools.

On macOS, the CA root certificate will be added to the "System" keychain.

[NOTE]
====
Chrome, Firefox, and Safari need no further configuration--you should restart your browser though.

Docker needs to be restarted.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following environment variables affect the creation of the root certificate:

`EASYRSA_REQ_CN`:: the common name of the root certificate; the default contains "Easy-RSA CA", the creation date, and the hostname
[#create-ca-expire]
`EASYRSA_CA_EXPIRE`:: the expiration time of the root certificate in days; the default is 180 days
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When the CA root certificate <<create-ca-expire,expires>>, the entire CA, xref:scripts/cert/copy-ca-root-cert.adoc[copied] root certificates, and all xref:scripts/cert/create-ca-based-cert.adoc[created] and xref:scripts/cert/copy-ca-based-cert.adoc[copied] certificates become invalid.

It is https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/issues/936[not possible] to renew the CA root certificate--therefore you need to xref:scripts/cert/delete-ca.adoc[delete] the CA and xref:scripts/cert/create-ca.adoc[create a new one].

If you have xref:scripts/cert/copy-ca-root-cert.adoc[copied] the root certificate to other locations you need to copy it again; if you have copied it into a Docker image you need to rebuild that image with the new certificate.

You need to xref:scripts/cert/create-ca-based-cert.adoc[create] new certificates based on this new CA.
====

[TIP]
====
Add `EASYRSA_PKI` to your shell's startup file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

.~/.zshrc
[,zsh]
----
export EASYRSA_PKI="${HOME}/.local/secrets/easyrsa/pki"
----
====

[TIP]
====
Copy the script into your Node.js project and add it as a https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-run-script[custom script] to your `package.json` file:

.package.json
[,json]
----
{
...
  "scripts": {
    "cert:ca:create": "scripts/create_ca.sh"
  }
}
----

[,console]
----
$ node --run cert:ca:create
----
====

== Usage

[,console]
----
$ export EASYRSA_PKI="${HOME}/.local/secrets/easyrsa/pki"
$ scripts/cert/create_ca.sh
Created certificate authority 'Easy-RSA CA (2024-08-05, example-host)'; expires on: 2025-02-01; certificate:

/Users/example/.local/secrets/easyrsa/pki/ca.crt
...
$ date -Idate
2024-08-05
$ stat -f '%A %N' ~/.local/secrets/easyrsa/pki/ca.crt
600 /Users/example/.local/secrets/easyrsa/pki/ca.crt

[#create-ca-mac]
=== macOS

Check your "System" keychain in _Keychain Access_; _When using this certificate_ should be set to "Always Trust":
