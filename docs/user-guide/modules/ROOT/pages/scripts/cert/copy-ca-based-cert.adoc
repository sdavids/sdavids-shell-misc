{script_url}[This script^] will copy a private key `key.pem` and a certificate-authority-based certificate `cert.pem`.

The following parameters are optional:

`c` :: the common name (`localhost` if not given) of the certificate
`d` :: the directory (`$PWD` if not given) the key and certificate should be copied to; will be created if it does not exit
`y` :: assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the xref:scripts/cert/create-ca.adoc[certificate authority has been created] and a xref:scripts/cert/create-ca-based-cert.adoc[private key and certificate have been created] before executing this script.
====

[WARNING]
====
Both `key.pem` and `cert.pem` https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-guideline/latest/01a-Secrets-Management[should not be checked into version control]!

If the given directory is inside a Git working tree, the script will offer to modify the https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore[.gitignore] file:

----
WARNING: key.pem and/or cert.pem is not ignored in '/Users/example/tmp/.gitignore'
