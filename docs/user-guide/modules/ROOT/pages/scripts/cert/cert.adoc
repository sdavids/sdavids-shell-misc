This section contains scripts related to <<standalone-certificates,standalone>> and <<certificate-authority-based-certificates,certificate authority based>> certificates.

== Standalone Certificates

[NOTE]
====
Standalone certificates are useful if you do not use mutual TLS or if the server's certificate verifier supports using a trust anchor as both a CA certificate and an end-entity certificate.

== Certificate Authority Based Certificates

[NOTE]
====
Certificate authority based certificates are useful if you want to use mutual TLS or if the server's certificate verifier does not support using a trust anchor as both a CA certificate and an end-entity certificate (e.g. https://docs.rs/craftls/latest/rustls/#non-features[rusttls]).
====

[TIP]
====
Standalone certificates are simpler to use than certificate authority based certificates.
