This section contains scripts related to <<standalone-certificates,standalone>> and <<certificate-authority-based-certificates,certificate-authority-based>> certificates.

[#standalone-certificates]
== Standalone Certificates

[NOTE]
====
Standalone certificates are useful if you do not use mutual TLS or if the server's certificate verifier supports using a trust anchor as both a CA certificate and an end-entity certificate.

xref:scripts/cert/delete-self-signed-cert.adoc[]:: delete a private key and a self-signed certificate
xref:scripts/cert/renew-self-signed-cert.adoc[]:: renew a private key and a self-signed certificate
xref:scripts/cert/verify-self-signed-cert.adoc[]:: verify a private key and a self-signed certificate

[#certificate-authority-based-certificates]
== Certificate-Authority-Based Certificates

[NOTE]
====
Certificate-authority-based certificates are useful if you want to use mutual TLS or if the server's certificate verifier does not support using a trust anchor as both a CA certificate and an end-entity certificate, (e.g., https://docs.rs/craftls/latest/rustls/#non-features[rusttls]).
====

[TIP]
====
Standalone certificates are simpler to use than certificate-authority-based certificates.
