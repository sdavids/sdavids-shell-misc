{script_url}[This script^] will delete the private key `key.pem` and the self-signed certificate `cert.pem` from the given directory (`$PWD` if not given).

If the given directory is not `$PWD` and is empty after the removal it will be removed as well.

The optional second parameter is the common name (`localhost` if not given) of the certificate to be removed.

On macOS, the certificate will be removed from the "login" keychain also.

[NOTE]
====
Chrome and Safari need no further configuration.

For Firefox the old certificate has to be <<delete-self-signed-cert-firefox,deleted manually>>.

Docker needs to be restarted.
