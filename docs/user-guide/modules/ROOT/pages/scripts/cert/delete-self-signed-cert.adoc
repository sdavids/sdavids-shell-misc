{script_url}[This script^] will delete a private key `key.pem` and a self-signed certificate `cert.pem`.

The following parameters are optional:

`c` :: the common name (`localhost` if not given) of the certificate
`d` :: the directory (`$PWD` if not given) containing the key and certificate; the directory will be also deleted if empty and not `$PWD`

On macOS, the certificate will be removed from the "login" keychain also.

[NOTE]
====
Chrome and Safari need no further configuration.

For Firefox, the old certificate has to be <<delete-self-signed-cert-firefox,deleted manually>>.

Docker needs to be restarted.
====

[TIP]
====
Copy the script into your Node.js project and add it as a https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-run-script[custom script] to your `package.json` file:
