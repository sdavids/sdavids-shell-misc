{script_url}[This script^] will delete the certificate authority.

The following parameter is optional:

`y` :: assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively

The certificate authority will be deleted from the following location:

Linux::
+
. `$EASYRSA_PKI` (if set)
. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/easyrsa/pki` (if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set)
. `$HOME/.easyrsa/pki`

macOS::
+
. `$EASYRSA_PKI` (if set)
. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/easyrsa/pki` (if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set)
. `$HOME/Library/Application Support/easyrsa/pki`

[NOTE]
====
Chrome, Firefox, and Safari need no further configuration--you should restart your browser though.

Docker needs to be restarted.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
On CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Mint, Red Hat, and Ubuntu you need to remove the CA root certificate from your trust store manually.

On macOS, you need to remove the CA root certificate from your "System" keychain in _Keychain Access_ manually.
====

[TIP]
====
Copy the script into your Node.js project and add it as a https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-run-script[custom script] to your `package.json` file:

.package.json
[,json]
----
{
...
  "scripts": {
    "cert:ca:delete": "scripts/delete_ca.sh"
  }
}
----

[,console]
----
$ node --run cert:ca:delete
----
====
